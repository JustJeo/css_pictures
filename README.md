# CSS Pictures
Hello there. This is a very simple website to showcase my CSS capabilities. This is mainly for my benefit to use as practice and to show my front end skills. This page can be added to throughout time with no real deadline or end goal in mind.

## Why Create This?
The main reason for this was simply to practice and refine my CSS skills. I consider myself very front-end savvy and it would be a shame to forget how to style a website.

I also came across a video on social media where a coder created different images on their website using only CSS. I was inspired by this to try and make my own version, but solely for the fact of keeping my coding skills up sharp and up to date.

## Future Plans
At the start of this project, I plan to only use vanilla CSS. I believe that if I can't do great work with the basics, then I'll be lost with the in-depth. So as I use this website for practice, I want to be sure that I'm well versed with the basics.

In the future I plan on importing libraries and other trypes of styling techniques like using Bootstrap, SASS, SCSS, Tailwind etc. If I create an image that isn't made with vanilla CSS, I'll be sure to mention it on the image.

As time passes, there will most likely be images that may not be 100% completed. This is expected as I don't have an end goal (as mentioned above). Chances are, there will be works in progress as I work on this website from time to time.

## Conclusion
I hope that any of you that stumble across this website will be entertained, even slightly, as I create images and visuals made from CSS. I pride myself in being a video game enthusiast who listens to k-pop so it's possible that a lot of the images I create will be replicated from those types of media.
